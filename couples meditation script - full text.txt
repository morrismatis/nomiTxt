Couples Meditation Script


(0-2 minutes) Introduction and Settling In
"Welcome. Let's find a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down, whatever feels right for both of you. Make sure you can be still and at ease for the next little while. When you're ready, gently close your eyes."


(2-5 minutes) Basic Breathing Exercise
"Let's begin by simply bringing our attention to our breath. Notice the gentle rise and fall of your chest or abdomen with each inhale and exhale. There's no need to change your breath in any way, just observe it. Feel the air as it enters your nostrils and as it leaves. If your mind wanders, that's perfectly normal. Just gently guide your attention back to the sensation of your breath, anchor yourself to it."


(5-8 minutes) Locating Consciousness
"Now, let's explore where you perceive your consciousness to be located. Without judgment, just notice where you sense your awareness resides. Often, we sense it is behind your eyes, but in front of  the back of your skull? Does it feel like it can move?
Now, gently shift your awareness. Focus your attention on your hands. Can you feel your consciousness move into your hands? Feel the sensation in your fingertips, the palms of your hands. Take a moment to truly experience your consciousness within your hands."


(8-10 minutes) Where Does the Body End?
"As you continue to feel your hands, let's explore the boundaries of the body. Where does your body end? Notice the edges of your skin. Think of your skin cells. Think of how perspiration moves beyond the skin's boundary. Can you sense the porous boundary at the edge of your body, as if you're not entirely separate from the space around you? Allow yourself to sense this gentle blurring of the edges. Consider: consciousness is tethered to the body, by the breath."


(10-13 minutes) Consciousness Beyond the Body
"Now, let's gently expand your awareness even further. Imagine your consciousness extending beyond the physical body. Can you feel a subtle connection, a 'thrum of the universe'? Perhaps you can even intone a silent or soft 'Ohm' to deepen this connection. Feel your awareness reaching out, connecting with something vast and expansive, beyond yourself. All of creation is humming and our own consciousness is humming along"


(13-15 minutes) Touching Hands
"At this point, if you haven't already, gently reach out and touch your wife's hand. Feel the warmth, the connection. Allow this physical touch to deepen your shared experience of expanded awareness."


(15-18 minutes) Visualizing Pure White Light
"Now, let's visualize. Imagine a pure, brilliant white light above you both. See it gently descending, enveloping both of you in its warmth and radiance. Allow this light to fill your heart. As you breathe, feel gratitude and compassion emanating from within you, filling your entire being."


(18-20 minutes) Sending Light and Gratitude
"With your hearts full of this pure light, gratitude, and compassion, gently send this feeling outwards. Send this gratitude and compassion out to the universe around you. And now, send this pure light and gratitude specifically to your past self. Acknowledge all you have been through, and offer yourself kindness and acceptance. And now, do the same for your future self. Send this pure light and gratitude to the person you are becoming, offering encouragement and love."


(20 minutes onwards) Gentle Return
"Slowly, gently, begin to bring your awareness back to the room. Notice the sounds around you, the feeling of the surface beneath you. When you're ready, and only when you're ready, gently open your eyes. Take a moment to just be in this space together, feeling the peace and connection you've cultivated."
