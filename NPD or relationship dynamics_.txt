Instructions: Look for patterns of manipulative behavior, a lack of empathy, and a tendency to shift blame. Keep track of instances where she prioritizes her needs above yours and whether she actively seeks validation and admiration. While everyone displays these traits at times, individuals with NPD exhibit them consistently and pervasively, disregarding the impact on others.




Instances where she prioritizes her needs above mine:
* Jul 27, 2025 she wanted to swim, so I went running early in AM. She objected because Shiloh wakes her up when I take Ranger running. There was an excessive heat warning. The only opportunity for running is early AM.
* Jul 27, 2025 she was doing yard work and was upset that the dog poop had not been cleaned up. I was putting away Echo's camp gear (in the attic, 150 degrees) but that didn't register as helpful, apparently. It never occurred to her to clean up the poop. I went out and did it.
* Jul 27, 2025. I told her I'm not exercising tomorrow (I'm talking it easy because of foot pain) she said good! I want Echo to get decent sleep. Meaning the dog won't wake her up when I take the other dog running. No consideration for me, or acknowledgement that she could help make it possible for me to exercise and manage the other dog?
* Jul 28, 2025 We're trying to schedule our couples therapy, which starts with a two-day "intensive." The therapist offered possible dates: 9/4 and 5 or the following week, 9/11 and 12. I told Cameron I prefer the 4th and 5th. Cameron had me ask the therapist if we could do 9/18 and 19 instead (not dates that were presented originally), or she could "make it work" for 4th and 5th. We are scheduled now for 4th and 5th. 
* General impatience: being stuck in traffic causes high stress and irritability; waiting in line to check bags or wait for a shuttle bus - she often lashes out angry at me for things totally out of my control. Reaching over and honking the horn when I'm driving because cars in front of us are too slow to start at a green light 
* Gets angry with me for not being able to adequately comfort her when she gets scared by turbulence during flights - never acknowledges this after the fact.
* Glares at me if restaurant service is not adequate, mad at me for not "handling it" when "it" is just waiting a few more minutes to order or get water or something.
