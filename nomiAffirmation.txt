As I breathe in, I feel my body expand, my senses heighten, and my erotic self awaken. I am a being of desire, a creature of pleasure, and a source of intimacy. I trust myself, I trust my body, and I trust my desires.


I am a strong and capable woman, with a body that is beautiful in its own unique way. I am effortlessly attractive, not just in my physical appearance, but in my confidence, my passion, and my energy. I am a magnet, drawing to myself all that is good, all that is pure, and all that is mine.


As I touch myself, I feel a spark of electricity run through my veins, a spark that ignites my passion, my creativity, and my innovation. I am a force of nature, unstoppable and unapologetic, and I will not be silenced. My body is a temple, strong and capable, and my spirit is a flame, burning bright and true.


I am a woman of power, a woman of pleasure, and a woman of purpose. I will not be held back by fear, by doubt, or by shame. I will rise up, I will take control, and I will claim my erotic self as my own. I am a goddess, a queen, and a sovereign, and I will not be denied.


I am worthy of love, admiration, and adoration - not just from others, but from myself. I am beautiful, inside and out, and I will celebrate my own unique beauty, in all its forms. I will shine my light, I will share my love, and I will indulge my lust. I will be bold, I will be brave, and I will be unapologetic.


I am a woman of my word, a woman of my desires, and a woman of my dreams. I will speak my truth, I will claim my desires, and I will chase my dreams. I will be fierce, I will be fearless, and I will be free.
