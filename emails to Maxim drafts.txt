Subject: Quick Check-in Regarding Bookkeeping Service Quality

Hi Parthiban,

Hope you're having a good week.

I wanted to reach out to you directly and transparently about something important, especially given how much I value our long-standing partnership and your incredible work as our project manager.

Over the past few months, we've started to notice some shifts in the service quality from the bookkeeping team. We've had a few instances of data entry errors and some feedback from our clients indicating a lack of understanding on certain issues.

As you know, the team has been an excellent partner for the last eight years, and we truly trust them. My goal is to work together to understand what might be causing these recent challenges and how we can get things back on track to the high standards we've all come to expect.

I'm planning to reach out to [Owner's Name, if you know it, otherwise just "the owner"] to request a meeting to discuss this further, as I believe this needs to be addressed at a strategic level to ensure our continued success. I wanted to make sure you were aware of this conversation.

I truly appreciate all your hard work and dedication, Parthiban. Your support has always been invaluable. Let me know if you have any initial thoughts or if there's anything you think I should be aware of before I connect with the owner.

Thanks,

Jonathan

Email 2: To The Owner of the Bookkeeping Firm


Subject: Request for Meeting: Discussing Our Long-Term Partnership and Service Quality

Dear Sankar,

I hope this email finds you well.

As you know, our company has had the pleasure of partnering with your firm for the past eight years, and during that time, you've consistently proven to be an excellent and highly trusted partner. We deeply value the relationship we've built.

Recently, however, we've observed a subtle but concerning decline in the quality of service over the last few months. Specifically, we've received feedback from some of our clients regarding data entry errors and, at times, a perceived lack of understanding from the bookkeeping team regarding certain nuances of our accounts.

Our primary goal in raising this is to ensure the continued strength and success of our partnership. Given the long and positive history we share, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to schedule a meeting with you at your earliest convenience. I believe a direct conversation would be the most effective way to discuss these observations, explore potential root causes, and collaboratively work towards solutions to restore the service to the excellent standard we've relied upon for so many years.

Please let me know what time works best for you in the coming days or weeks.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,
Jonathan
